# **GT Modellista Blog - Introduction**
GT Modellista is blog site for car enthusiasts to share their passions with other like-minded individuals from around the world. This project is a Full-Stack development website built using the Django framework. GT Modellista allows registered users to post articles in two seperate categories, 'Build Threads' for vehicles and 'Diecasts' for scale-model collections. Registered users are also able to like and comment on posts made by other members of the community.
