### **Agile Methodology**

For planning the developement and implementation of GT Modellista, a project kanban board was used as an Agile Tool through Github. This project board utilised issues as 'User Stories', a link can be found [here](https://github.com/AndyL86/gt-modellista/issues).

To help define the functionalities and prioritise key features, these 'User Stories' were broken down into 3 categories of importance; 'Must Have', 'Should Have' and 'Could Have'.

'Must Have' represents a feature or functionality that is essential to the site, 'Should Have' is a defined requirement needed for the site and 'Could Have' is determined to be optional.

### **The Scope**

#### **The Site's Main Goals:**
- To provide users with a user-friendly and positive experience when using GT Modellista.
- To provide users with a clear understanding of the site's purpose.
- To provide controlled functionality based on a user's permissions.
- To provide user's with a profile that allows them to manage their own content.
